# Project3-Team2
Description:

This project uses several different technologies, including Pandas, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib, to compare medical records and population-wide disease data with various other datasets to find uncanny correlations. This project aims to compare many different data sets to find these correlations. Data comparisons include chronic respiratory diseases against air quality and diabetic symptoms against stroke symptoms, and more fringe comparisons such as the rate of bank failure against the rate of sexually transmitted diseases. Through a wider scope of data, this project aims to determine both direct and indirect causes of common diseases that may be overlooked by a more narrow dataset.
