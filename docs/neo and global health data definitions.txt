i want to use python pandas to find correlations using the following two data sets: 
dataset 1: NASA NEO/Close Approaches 1960-2060
Column Descriptions
des:
The designation or identifier of the Near-Earth Object (NEO). This is usually an alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies the object.
Example: 2018 AM12 (a specific asteroid discovered in 2018).

orbit_id
The unique identifier for the NEO's specific orbital configuration during the close approach.
Example: 22(indicating the 22nd observation or refinement of this object's orbit).

jd:
The Julian Date of the close approach, a continuous count of days used in astronomy for precise timekeeping.
Example: 2436943.5 (equivalent to January 9, 1960, 14:30 UTC).

cd:
The calendar date and time of the close approach, given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
Example: 1960-Jan-09 14:30 (indicating the NEO's closest approach occurred on January 9, 1960, at 14:30 UTC).

dist:
The nominal (most likely) distance between the NEO and Earth during the close approach, measured in astronomical units (AU).
Example: 0.028528 AU (~4.27 million kilometers or ~2.65 million miles).

dist_min:
The minimum possible distance, accounting for uncertainties in the NEO's trajectory.
Example: 0.027375 AU (~4.10 million kilometers or ~2.55 million miles).

dist_max:
The maximum possible distance, considering uncertainties in the object's orbit.
Example: 0.029682 AU (~4.44 million kilometers or ~2.76 million miles).

v_rel:
The velocity of the NEO relative to Earth during the close approach, measured in kilometers per second (km/s).
Example: 11.381602 km/s (~40,973 km/h or ~25,461 mph).

v_inf:
The "infinity velocity," or the object's velocity relative to Earth if Earthâ€™s gravitational influence were not present, measured in km/s.
Example: 11.373393 km/s (~40,944 km/h or ~25,441 mph).

t_sigma_f:
The uncertainty in the timing of the close approach, often represented as a formatted string.
Example: <00:01 (indicating the approach time is accurate to within less than 1 minute).

h:
The absolute magnitude of the NEO, representing its brightness. Smaller values typically indicate brighter objects.
Example: 21.16 (indicating a relatively small and/or dim asteroid).

fullname:
The full name or detailed designation of the NEO, including its provisional or alternative identifiers.

dataset 2: Global Health Statistics
Column Descriptions
Country: The name of the country where the health data was recorded.
Year: The year in which the data was collected.
Disease Name: The name of the disease or health condition tracked.
Disease Category: The category of the disease (e.g., Infectious, Non-Communicable).
Prevalence Rate (%): The percentage of the population affected by the disease.
Incidence Rate (%): The percentage of new or newly diagnosed cases.
Mortality Rate (%): The percentage of the affected population that dies from the disease.
Age Group: The age range most affected by the disease.
Gender: The gender(s) affected by the disease (Male, Female, Both).
Population Affected: The total number of individuals affected by the disease.
Healthcare Access (%): The percentage of the population with access to healthcare.
Doctors per 1000: The number of doctors per 1000 people.
Hospital Beds per 1000: The number of hospital beds available per 1000 people.
Treatment Type: The primary treatment method for the disease (e.g., Medication, Surgery).
Average Treatment Cost (USD): The average cost of treating the disease in USD.
Availability of Vaccines/Treatment: Whether vaccines or treatments are available.
Recovery Rate (%): The percentage of people who recover from the disease.
DALYs: Disability-Adjusted Life Years, a measure of disease burden.
Improvement in 5 Years (%): The improvement in disease outcomes over the last five years.
Per Capita Income (USD): The average income per person in the country.
Education Index: The average level of education in the country.
Urbanization Rate (%): The percentage of the population living in urban areas.

how should i join these tables and perform correlations?
